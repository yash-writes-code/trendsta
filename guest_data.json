And you can control it from messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram or iMessage from anywhere in the world. It doesn't just respond, it actually does things. It can send emails, manage your calendar, control your browser, and can even negotiate with car dealers. One user reportedly saved $4,200 on a car purchase using it. And people are already using it for trading stocks, crypto, and commodities. It remembers everything. Ask ChatGPT what you talked about last Tuesday and it draws a blank. ClaudeBot knows your preferences, your projects, and even random ideas you mentioned weeks ago. The craziest part? It costs around $25 a month to run, and it reaches out to you with morning briefings, stock alerts, and meeting reminders, all automatically.

So running a 70 billion parameter model like Lama 3 normally requires 140 gigs of GPU memory. That's two enterprise GPUs that cost more than a car. But Air LLM does something clever. Instead of loading the entire model at once, it loads one layer at a time, runs the computation, and then frees the memory before loading the next layer. Think of it like reading a book one page at a time instead of holding the whole library in your hands. But there's a trade-off, it's slow and takes 4 to 35 seconds per response. So this isn't for real-time chatbots. And for researchers running experiments overnight, students learning AI without cloud bills, or startups processing thousands of documents in batches, this might be effective. As open source models keep getting better, the real challenge shifts from building smarter models to making them easier to run. And tools like AirLLM make adoption bigger, cheaper and actually practical.",

So researchers just built an AI called MyMix that can take characters from completely different universes and make them interact naturally in the same video. Normally, AI video tools struggle when you try to mix cartoon characters with real people because they've never existed together in any training data. My mix solved this by teaching the AI to understand characters as separate concepts, like their appearance, how they move, and their personality quirks. All stored independently. So when you ask it to generate, We Bear Bears cooking with Tom and Jerry in a cartoon kitchen, it knows exactly how each one of them would stumble around and how Jerry would outsmart them. The researchers trained it on 81 hours of content, covering everything from Tom and Jerry to young Sheldon. And the AI preserves each character's original art style perfectly. Mr. Bean stays realistic while Tom stays animated, even when they're in the same frame. This is basically the beginning of AI that can create any crossover content you can imagine.",

          "transcript": "Siri was useless for 13 years. This viral bot fixes everything. X users buying Mac minis instantly. Let me explain this chaos. This is Claude Bot. It went viral on X last week, and the memes are wild. Everyone is panicked buying Mac minis to run bots, and I forgot to buy Apple Store. One guy even tweeted, why is everyone buying a Mac mini to run Claude Bot instead of just using a $5 VPS? Because, well, they want the vibe. So what is Claude Bot? It's an open source AI assistant that runs on your computer 24-7. You control it through WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, wherever you chat. But here's the crazy part. It has full access to your browser, email, files, calendar, everything. It's like having JavaScript, except it's a lobster and sometimes sends the wrong email. Here's what actual users posted. One developer said, I built a Mac OS app from a concert via WhatsApp. Claude Watt wrote the code while I watched the band. Another said, I asked it to build a skill to check my university assignments. It built the skill, then started using it on its own. One person cleared three years of email backlog in 30 minutes. But then there's this. The creator himself said, run this on isolated hardware because something will go sideways. And even people reported wrong email sent. Files accidentally shared. One person's bot tried to order pizza at 3am, unclear if bug or feature. So yeah, it's that powerful and that dangerous. Why the hype? Because for 13 years, Siri has been useless. Claude Bot actually does things. It works while you sleep. It remembers you. And one user summed it up perfectly. This is the future. Claude running 24-7 on its own computer, messaging you first with briefings and insights. It's free, open source and kind of sketchy. Would you use it? Let's have a chat in comments and follow for more such viral AI innovations.",

Now these small teams can charge thousands of dollars because they replace human roles instead of just providing the software. They target industries like law firms, dentists and HVAC, where manual tasks slow everything down. So let's break down the stack they use to wire these systems together. Tools like VoiceFlow or WAPI handle phone calls and booking 24 hours a day. They connect make.com and GPT-4-0 to analyze photos of plumbing or electrical issues and generate instant quotes. For growth, they use clay and instantly to research prospects and send messages that feel genuinely personal. What this really means is that the market has shifted from manual maintenance to AI efficiency. So make sure you comment agency and we'll send you the link to the tools in your DM.",

I'm Nivedan, an AI strategy consultant to top CEOs. Most people just use ATS once and apply to multiple jobs without customization, which means higher rejections, no interviews. So I built an app with Replit's latest feature that builds not just a web app, but a fully functional mobile app for both iOS and Android. It gives you an ATS score for each job description. And not just that, it also acts like an application tracker, removing the need for Google Sheets. It even got my friend five interview calls within just a week. All I needed to do was to just describe the app and it built the complete app with backend, database, authentication, and AI integrations. All from my smartphone in 30 minutes without any coding experience. And it can even publish this app directly on Apple Store. Honestly, it's insane. The world is full of problems. And now you have no excuse to build solutions. Replit is free to start right now. So comment Replit and I'll send you the link in your DM.",

So Google has released its video model VO3, which is so realistic that people are building entire channels around AI characters. The secret to its success is the way it maintains physical properties and natural lighting in every shot. While a direct subscription to this tech costs around $200 a month, there is a way to skip that fee. All you need to do is wire up an automation using Kai AI to generate these clips for about 40 cents each. So let's break down how it works. One agent brainstorms viral concepts, while another translates those ideas into cinematic prompts for the model. This workflow allows you to produce high quality video content without a camera or a massive budget. What this really means is that the barrier to entry for professional animation has basically disappeared. Make sure you comment Yeti and we'll send you the entire automation code and don't forget to follow BuiltAcentral for more such content.",

Каждый шаг становится частью инновационной системы, преобразующей механическое человеческое движение в чистую электрическую энергию. Специальные пьезоэлектрические панели, установленные под полом, улавливают вибрации и давление. Полученная энергия может сохраняться в аккумуляторах или использоваться сразу для освещения станции и работы турникетов, что значительно снижает зависимость от традиционных источников электроэнергии и поддерживает устойчивую городскую инфраструктуру. Этот метод превращает повседневное движение в практически бесконечный возобновляемый источник энергии.\nБудущее городов создаётся прямо под нашими ногами.\n.\n.\n#shibuya #tokyo #japan #technology #future energy innovation sustainable urban science discovery viral trending reels explore fyp aesthetic lifehacks motivation facts",

As in ECLO Labs, the AI company? Yeah, I guess. And you said yes. I didn't really have a choice. I'm not worried about work. I'm worried about robots. Jack, a word regarding your decision to integrate ECLO's AI onto our network. I would like to formally object. I don't have time for this, Gilfoil. I don't mind. AI is starting to operate on levels we don't even understand. Elon Musk himself gives humanity a 5% shot at surviving AI, and he is a Walt Disney-level optimist. Right now, we are a closed system. You shut down our eight developers and the system goes dark. But once we launch to the world, to potentially millions of users, there's no shutting down, Richard. Are you prepared to be responsible for giving sophisticated AI that kind of power? You're taking a technology with limitless potential and letting it run free on an experimental network that cannot be controlled or destroyed, all because you owe Monica and Lori a solid. Yes. The sheer banality of it all is very upsetting.",

While Google stated that its voice assistant would only register people's speech when consumers uttered an activation phrase, such as \"Hey Google,\" the consumers claimed that their devices recorded them even without using such language.",

A literal kill switch that can disable your car during a declared “state of emergency.”\n\n“This is so Orwellian that Orwell himself wouldn’t believe it.”\n\nHe warns this isn’t about protecting drivers, it’s about power.\n“Congress does not represent the voice or the will of the people anymore.”\n\nOnce the government has the ability to remotely shut down vehicles, movement itself becomes conditional.\nWho decides what counts as an emergency?\nWho controls the switch?\n\n“If we don’t fundamentally change how our government behaves, we are forever lost as citizens.”\n\nDo you support the U.S. government having the ability to shut off your car?",
