While every competitor is still figuring out how to tune their engine, IONQ just announced they have a car 36 quadrillion times faster and they also built the highway, the gas station network, and the satellite navigation system for everyone.\n\nThey’re not running the race.\nThey own the circuit.\n5 years ahead.

Acquired Oct 2025.\n\nNetworking & Comms:\n\n→ ID Quantique — quantum-safe cryptography & QKD (majority stake)\n→ Skyloom Global — space-based optical comms, 90 terminals for SDA missions\n→ Lightsynq Technologies — quantum networking\n→ Qubitekk — quantum networking infrastructure\n\nSpace:\n→ Capella Space — SAR satellites for space-based intelligence\n\nSo when you look at $CCCX or $FEIM in quantum sensing IonQ now owns Vector Atomic, which plays in that same space but integrated into a much larger platform.\n\nThat's the moat: compute + sensing + networking + space, all under one roof. No other quantum company has this.\n\nHappy to share more 🤝",

Quantum isn’t coming. It’s already here.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n⚛️ The hybrid era — CPU + GPU + QPU working together. Quantum doesn’t replace classical computing. It extends it.\n\n🔧 Real use cases today:\n\n→ US Navy: corrosion costs $20B/year classical computers can’t simulate materials at the molecular level to find solutions. Quantum can.\n\n→ Hyundai: designing better EV batteries (30-40% of vehicle cost)\n\n→ Airbus: freight optimization\n→ AstraZeneca: drug discovery\n\n☁️ Democratization— “Anyone with a credit card can experiment with quantum computing today via the cloud.”\n\n🏛️ The sovereignty message:\n\n“ Investing in this infrastructure is a matter of national defense. The decisions made now will determine sovereignty and competitiveness for the next 100 years.”\n\n🔮 Timeline: Broad impact in 2-5 years as hardware and software mature.\n\nHer prediction? \n\nEvery national supercomputing center and eventually every enterprise data center will have a quantum computer.\n\n🏗️ Think of it this way:\n\nClassical computing is like a team of architects drawing plans by hand (CPU) with fast calculators (GPU). Adding quantum (QPU) is like giving them a multidimensional simulation software they don’t throw away their old tools, but they can now design structures whose complexity was simply impossible to imagine or test before.\n\n📺 Full panel below 👇\n\n#IONQ #QuantumComputing #CES2026 #AI",

        "text": "$OKLO ⚛️ “We’re not even at the start of the game yet. We’re still in warm-ups.”\n\nThat’s @jakedewitte, CEO @oklo at #CES2025 with @JobsOhio . Standing room only.\n\nHere’s what he revealed:\n\n⚡ SMR → 75MW, agile deployment, learning by doing\n\n🏗️ Material efficiency → less steel, copper and concrete per MWh than any other energy source\n\n🔥 Sodium-cooled reactors → historical technology with proven operational superiority\n\n📍 Ohio → “There’s nothing like it in the entire country” – full nuclear hub under construction\n\n🎓 Multi-million dollar investment at Ohio State University to create a standalone nuclear engineering department\n\n🧩 The only platform covering: fuel manufacturing → power generation → workforce training\n\nThe gap with competitors? It’s only getting wider.\n\n🏎️ Think of it this way:\n\nImagine switching from a giant 1970s supercomputer to a modern, agile cloud server network. That’s exactly what Oklo is doing to the power grid. No more building monuments over 10 years. They’re deploying an intelligent, powerful network.\n\nThey’re not building power plants.\n\nThey’re building the energy infrastructure of the future.\n\nAnd Ohio is becoming their HQ.\n\n📺 Watch the full CES panel 👇\n\n#OKLO #Nuclear #SMR #CES2025 #CleanEnergy #Ohio",

          "transcript": "This person from Bengaluru, Pankaj Tambar, just turned his helmet into a traffic police device with AI agents that detect road violations, attach proofs with location and number plates and send it straight to police. At its core, the system basically uses a forward-facing camera that continuously captures road footage, identifies vehicles in near real-time using something like YOLO, an object detection model, and flags violations like missing helmets, wrong side driving or stunts. Once detected, the system extracts number plates using OCR, attaches location and timestamps and sends the entire incident to Bengaluru Traffic Police. What's interesting is how portable the setup is. The entire system runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B connected to a camera, a GPS module and a power bank using USB, while the internet comes through the phone's hotspot. Currently leading the back-end team at Inmobi, the second-floor guy has also confirmed that Bengaluru City Police have already contacted him, suggesting that authorities might actually be interested in the prototype.",

          "transcript": "China can kill iPhones tomorrow, end AI overnight, America just called India for help. Namaste to everyone who's watching from home. US Ambassador Sergio Gore just confirmed their invite on India to join their polysilicon alliance. Reason? China owns 93% of something America desperately need. That's silicon. Not just any silicon. Polysilicon. The material that powers every AI chip, every smartphone, every missile system. And here's the terrifying part. 9 out of 10 top manufacturers. All Chinese. America realized something scary. If China decides to cut supply tomorrow, the entire western tech industry collapses. No more iPhones. No more AI. No more advanced weapons. That's when they created PaxSilica. An alliance of US, Japan, South Korea, UK, Israel, etc. Their mission? Build an alternative silicon supply chain. But there was a problem. They couldn't do it alone. They needed a country with massive manufacturing capability. Millions of engineers and a strategic position against China. The answer? Enter India. Last week, America officially invited India to join PaxSilica. Today, I'm pleased to announce that India will be invited to join this group of nations as a full member next month. This isn't charity. America needs us. And India is about to get something in exchange, which is not confirmed yet. Official. To be invited on next month. If India says yes, this could supercharge our own chip fabs, AI data centers and design ecosystem. But also lock us deeper into a US-led tech club that decides who we can buy advanced tech from and who we can sell it to. What do you think? Is this India's biggest opportunity or just another western agenda? Follow for more AI-related breakdowns that actually matter.",

You simply open the Gemini app, upload a video, and ask if it's AI generated and that's it. At the center of this is SynthID. Think of it as an invisible pattern that Google embeds into every video it generates. It is not a visible watermark that you can strip out. Instead, it lives inside the video itself, baked into the pixels and motion. And because of that, it survives most compression, resizing, and edits. Having said that, it only works with videos generated by Veo, since SynthID isn't universally adopted yet. But verification is only one part of the update. Google also rolled out Veo 3.1, which now supports native vertical video with a more expressive model, which is better at keeping characters, objects, and backgrounds consistent. The third major change is quality. Across all Veo models, you can now upscale videos to 1080p and even 4K, which is useful for professional video editors. Overall, these updates show that Google is pushing both sides forward at once, making it easier to generate ultra-realistic videos while also making it easier to detect them.",

That's right, Apple and Google have just entered a multi-year deal under which the next generation of Apple Foundation models powering Apple Intelligence and Siri will now be using Google Gemini. Now, this is not the first time Apple has tried to fix things by partnering with someone else. Back in 2024, Apple integrated ChatGPT to its system, but that was never meant to fix Apple Intelligence or Siri. ChatGPT was just an extra tool for things like writing, summaries or answering open-ended questions. Simply put, Siri itself was not running on ChatGPT, it was simply delegating to ChatGPT. So the core issue remained the same, Siri still felt useless beyond setting alarms. But this new deal with Google is different in a very real way. This time, Apple is not just handing hard queries to another tool, but building Apple Intelligence and Siri on top of Gemini itself. This also does not mean Apple is handing user data to Google. Both have clearly mentioned that Apple Intelligence and Siri will still run on-device or fall back to Apple's own private cloud compute when needed, meaning Apple will still control what data is seen. Having said that, the new Siri will likely be demoed at WWDC in June 2026. So let's see what Apple cooks this time.",

You start off by giving Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit or create files in that folder, like creating a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or producing a first draft from scattered notes. Then, once you've set a task, Claude makes a plan and steadily completes it, looping you in along the way. One crucial detail is that Claude will also stop and ask before taking any significant actions so you can course correct as needed. Plus, you can even pair CoWork with Claude in Chrome for tasks that need browser access. It's already available as a research preview for ClaudeMax subscribers in the macOS app, but if you're on another plan, you can join the waitlist for future access.",

          "transcript": "F1 races are happening without humans. 300 km per hour, zero drivers. The AI never crashes. This changes everything. These cars have 7 cameras, 4 radars, 3 lidars and 1 AI brain, making life or death decisions in 0.1 seconds. The crazy part, this tech will be in your car by 2030. What you're seeing is the world's most advanced AI testing ground, the autonomous racing league. But this isn't about racing. This is about making your future car impossible to crash. Let me break down why this matters. At 300 km per hour, these cars travel 82 meters every single second. A 100 millisecond delay means 8 meters of error. That's the difference between a clean overtake and a deadly crash. So, the AI has to be perfect. Here's the genius part. When you test self-driving at normal city speeds, you might drive for years without facing a dangerous situation. But at racing speeds, the AI faces extreme scenarios every few seconds. Multi-car interactions, split-second overtaking decisions, sudden crashes ahead, all compressed into minutes instead of years. The algorithms that survive this chaos, they're battle-tested. Proven under conditions 5 times more extreme than your daily commute. Now here's where it gets interesting. Every innovation from F1 racing eventually reaches your car. Carbon fibre, active suspension, paddle shifters, energy recovery, all started on the racetrack. This autonomous racing will give us something bigger. Emergency braking that never fails. Lane keeping that works at night and rain. Collision avoidance that thinks faster than any human. By 2035, the self-driving market will be worth $5.4 trillion. And the technology driving it, it's being perfected right now at 300 km per hour. Would you buy a car with an AI brain, trained at F1 speeds? Follow for more tech that's about to change everything.",

          "transcript": "Researchers just created a drug that increases your sleep quality by 90% without making you sleep longer. It's called BMB-101. And to understand how it works, you need to understand a small region in your brain called the locus coeruleus. Think of it as the brain's stay-awake switch. When it is firing, your brain stays alert and actively resists REM sleep, a major contributor to sleep quality. But once BMB-101 enters your system, it targets that switch directly. It acts on a serotonin receptor called 5-HT1A, which gently lowers activity in the locus coeruleus, helping your brain increase just the REM sleep. And the results show. In phase 2 clinical trials, as released by Bright Minds Biosciences, REM increased from just 56 minutes to nearly 107 minutes per night, a 90% jump. As for side effects, they seem relatively low so far, like mild fatigue, headaches or constipation. Overall, BMB-101 points to a completely different way of treating sleep disorders. And if future trials confirm these results, this could drastically change our collective well-being.",

Right now, you're probably using AI for simple prompts. But the game is changing. Major companies are leading the transformation, integrating AI agents that handle complex tasks autonomously, from managing your inbox to generating reports. Take Microsoft's Copilot, for example. It's being embedded across Microsoft 365, Teams, Windows, and Edge. It will be able to join meetings on your behalf, summarize discussions, and even draft responses. Imagine a 7-person team scaling to the output of a 70-person team. That's the power of these AI agents. Handling everything from meeting minutes to in-depth analysis, boosting productivity exponentially. And it's not just Microsoft. OpenAI is pushing the boundaries with its API for agents, paving the way for even more advanced agentic systems. These agents are set to accelerate research and complex problem-solving, like in the biological sciences, showcasing AI's incredible potential to tackle some of the world's biggest challenges. Google is also in the race, integrating AI across Search, Workspace, and more. Your browsing, coding, and document creation are all becoming smarter and more automated. Notions 3.0 Agent is another game-changer. Automating the busy work that consumes your day, and allowing your team to collaborate more effectively. This agent can search across all your pages, messages, and even the web, creating the ultimate knowledge base for your company. For solo creators, AI agents handling tasks from brainstorming to onboarding. Reduce timelines 3x, one-person teams scale to 70. Future of Work AI empowers productivity. Comment Agent for my 3-Agent Blueprint.",

Oh, jadi betul ini adalah buatan manual illustrator, jadi akurasinya tepat Nah, ini hasil klasifikasinya, ini adalah buatan AI generatif dengan tingkat keyakinan 97,7% Nah, kalau ini buatan illustrator dengan confident levelnya adalah 92,45% Kalau ini, nah ini sebenarnya buatan AI generatif ya, tapi diklasifikasikan sebagai manual illustrator dengan tingkat keyakinan 90,23% Jadi memang tidak selalu ya menghasilkan akurasi yang benar, jadi ini yang false positifnya Tapi sebenarnya rata-rata akurasinya berapa Faraz?

You try to do all you can for them, you want to help them every way you can, but they have to help themselves along the way too. And the best way to do that is that mindset, that belief, how they feel about things, stuff like that are all going to play a huge factor. And the arc of justice will bend toward it as long as we allow that arc to happen. That's what makes our system so brilliant. It takes time, it takes patience, it takes faith, but it can get there as long as we believe in that. And that's what I'm hoping to inspire, the belief in this, that it still can happen. 5% of a doctor's time is spent on things like coding, pre-authorization, quality compliance, and all of those are a tremendous burden and really aren't making a lot of difference. And it said, They say freedom is a step away. Open the door, freedom going. My own mother, brother, sister, they gone way before. Get away this freedom door. Don't know what's back beyond this door.

Chrome loading pages was shown in sync with dramatic real-world comparisons, such as a potato being fired from a cannon, alongside sound and lightning tests, to visually demonstrate how quickly the browser rendered content.\n\nThese demonstrations were not created using CGI. Every test was captured using high-speed cameras and measured against actual rendering times, making the results tangible and easy for anyone to understand.\n\nRather than debating performance charts and benchmarks, Google transformed browser speed into a real-world experience. This creative approach gave Chrome a memorable and lasting moment during the browser wars of the early internet era.\n\nCredit: Google Chrome\n\nLike this content?

Oh, jadi betul ini adalah buatan manual illustrator, jadi akurasinya tepat Nah, ini hasil klasifikasinya, ini adalah buatan AI generatif dengan tingkat keyakinan 97,7% Nah, kalau ini buatan illustrator dengan confident levelnya adalah 92,45% Kalau ini, nah ini sebenarnya buatan AI generatif ya, tapi diklasifikasikan sebagai manual illustrator dengan tingkat keyakinan 90,23% Jadi memang tidak selalu ya menghasilkan akurasi yang benar, jadi ini yang false positifnya Tapi sebenarnya rata-rata akurasinya berapa Faraz?

Right now, you're probably using AI for simple prompts. But the game is changing. Major companies are leading the transformation, integrating AI agents that handle complex tasks autonomously, from managing your inbox to generating reports. Take Microsoft's Copilot, for example. It's being embedded across Microsoft 365, Teams, Windows, and Edge. It will be able to join meetings on your behalf, summarize discussions, and even draft responses. Imagine a 7-person team scaling to the output of a 70-person team. That's the power of these AI agents. Handling everything from meeting minutes to in-depth analysis, boosting productivity exponentially. And it's not just Microsoft. OpenAI is pushing the boundaries with its API for agents, paving the way for even more advanced agentic systems. These agents are set to accelerate research and complex problem-solving, like in the biological sciences, showcasing AI's incredible potential to tackle some of the world's biggest challenges. Google is also in the race, integrating AI across Search, Workspace, and more. Your browsing, coding, and document creation are all becoming smarter and more automated. Notions 3.0 Agent is another game-changer. Automating the busy work that consumes your day, and allowing your team to collaborate more effectively. This agent can search across all your pages, messages, and even the web, creating the ultimate knowledge base for your company. For solo creators, AI agents handling tasks from brainstorming to onboarding. Reduce timelines 3x, one-person teams scale to 70. Future of Work AI empowers productivity.
